              The first group project from the Fullstack Academy Bootcamp, this

              This is the classic Snake game made in <strong>JavaScript</strong>
              . Eat the red square to grow while avoiding your tail and the
              walls. I added a difficulty slider to increase the Snake speed, as
              well as a score tracker to keep track of your highscore (for as
              long as the window is left open).

              chances to guess a randomly generated number. I added hints that
              change dynamically with every guess. I also added a hint button
              that gives you 3 answers, one of which is the correct answer, the
              other two are random numbers.
